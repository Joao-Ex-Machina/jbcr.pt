I am a 23 year old **Electrical and Computer Eng. PhD student** at [Instituto Superior Técnico - ULisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt) , with a [knack](/knack.mp4) for all things FPGA, embedded systems and reconfigurable computing. I am also a early-stage researcher at INESC-ID and INESC-INOVLabs.

I was born in Lisbon, Portugal on the 16th of September. My family is originally from Arraiolos, in Alentejo Central (mother's side) and from Lisbon and Portalegre, Alto Alentejo (father's side).

My PhD project - **SMARTCHIP** - has the objective to design a AI accelerator for embedded enviroments, with the possibility to be reconfigured for different networks. This accelerator will be prototyped in FPGA, being developed as an ASIC in a later stage. This project is supervised by Prof. Horácio Neto, Prof. Mário Véstias, Prof. Rui Policarpo Duarte, Prof. José Teixeira de Sousa and Prof. João Vaz.

I finished my ECE Master's in November 2025, having majored in **Computer Systems** and minoring in **Electronic Circuits and Systems**. For my MSc Thesis I designed **ARES**, a Hardware/Software Co-Designed Embedded System for a Swin Transformer Layer execution, targeting aerial image segmentation. This work was developed at INESC-ID/INESC-INOV under Prof. Horácio Neto and Prof. Mário Véstias. My thesis was awarded a 19/20 grade.

From 2023 to July 2025 I was a **Teaching Assistant** at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://deec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) teaching on the following courses:

- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Digital Systems
- Programming
- Computer Architectures

I enjoyed this experience throughly, having won the **Excelence in Teaching** award for the school year of 23/24.

I have also been **hackin' and tinkerin'** while involved with the [HackerSchool](https://hackerschool.dev) hackerspace, which I belong to since 2021. At HackerSchool I have assumed the following functions:

- **Board Member (Marketing)** in 2022
- **President** from 2022 to 2024
- **Board Member (Chief Hacker Officer)** from 2024 until now
