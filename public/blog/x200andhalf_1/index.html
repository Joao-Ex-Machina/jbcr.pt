<p><em>How did our glorious hero fall into the ThinkPad rabbit hole?</em></p>
<p>Well, it started a little after adopting Linux as my preferred OS (I use arch btw). I was enjoying the new life of my Ideapad&hellip;which did not last much long.</p>
<p>During the pandemic I developed the horrible habit of going to bed with my computer, which prompted me to wake-up in the middle of the night with a loud <em>THUMP</em> of the computer hitting the floor?</p>
<p>Did I change this habit after the computer falling too many times? I absolutely <em>did not</em>!</p>
<p>All this accumulated damaged and fatigue started wearing on the chassis, particularly on the side of the power port. By the time I was finishing the Algorithms and Data Structures course at the end of the second year&rsquo;s first quarter I was using the Ideapad with a large metal clamp to ensure the connectivity of the charger (the battery also started to wear off by this time - the computer has ran a 6.5 year cycle of daily use and abuse).</p>
<p>I did not need much convincing about having to retire this laptop, however I did have to convince others that replacing it by a Thinkpad from 2013, bought from a goverment official, by the cheap price of a little over 100€, was in fact a good idea. That&rsquo;s how I acquired the T430 (Khâzad-Dûm) Thinkpad, which I daily drived for the remainder of my BSc and MSc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re talking about a T430 Thinkpad, how did you get the x200?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fun story: This X200 (Aglarond) was bought as a Linux replacement for Martim after we (presumably) fried his old Linux laptop while trying to upgrade it (we in fact did not, we only super-charged the security capacitors, and therefore that same computer was restored a year later). And so this X200 was bought as a joint venture where Martim contributed 25% of the moolah and I contributed 75% (I felt bad for having (presumably) fried his PC at the time - a guy has feelings).</p>
<h1 id="the-x200-and-me">The X200 and me</h1>
<p>Honestly, I have kinda been an absent father to the X200, with this machine being used by Martim for around 75% of its lifetime.</p>
<p>Has I regularly upgraded the T430: new battery pack, new screen , dock station, installed a corebooted MoBo on it&hellip;you name it!</p>
<p>Damn did I enjoy the heck of it, It is still my favourite machine.</p>
<p><em>But&hellip;</em></p>
<p>But when it came to travelling I was craving something <em>lighter</em>, something more <em>portable</em> like  a 12&rsquo;&rsquo; Thinkpad B^))</p>
<p>Also the T430 hinges have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/10yv52b/repairing_t430_hinges/">this problem</a> where they break and its a pain to replace them.</p>
<p>And so, like the Don Corleone to the undertaker Bonasera, I asked him for a favour&hellip;For the X200 to come into my possesion for some time.</p>
<p>Altough I like to joke that the T430 was my back and leg workout, I soon understood why the classic X-series is so famous - this guy is seriously <em>ultra</em> portable, I don&rsquo;t even feel it in my bag! Its amazing!</p>
