Yup, that’s right I deleted most of my social media (again), in this case I deleted instagram (again).


#Prologue: There and back again

“Wait a second….again?”

Yes indeed attentive reader - again

After my last breakup, I deleted instagram as I had no more use for it - no more couple photos or stories. 
Also this would time would better blur those past four years from my mind.

These deletion came as the last piece in a “abandoning social media” saga, as I had previously stopped using WhatsApp and other common methods of interaction.

I continued using Discord for my “socialization” - In a move I can only describe as “nerd arrogance”, since Discord offers no significant advantage to other communication methods: Its not private, its freemium, and its not open software.


##Back into the modern world of digital bubble gum interactions

As my real-life interactions got progressivly better, my “nerd rage against the modern world” diminished.

I installed WhatsApp again to the delight of friends and family, as it is a very convenient method of communication (since everyone uses it, although I still have no fond feeling for it)

….And I went back to the instagram trap.

But it was different this time

Honestly, I installed instagram as a soft dating app (note: Went on a total of 0 dates thanks to instagram).

This is of course very sad, and only a symptom of a deeper issue.
