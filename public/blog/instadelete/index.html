After my last breakup, I deleted instagram as I had no more use for it - no more couple photos or stories.
Also this would time would better blur those past four years from my mind.
These deletion came as the last piece in a “abandoning social media” saga, as I had previously stopped using WhatsApp and other common methods of interaction.">

<p>Yup, that’s right I deleted most of my social media (again), in this case I deleted instagram (again).</p>
<p>#Prologue: There and back again</p>
<p>“Wait a second….again?”</p>
<p>Yes indeed attentive reader - again</p>
<p>After my last breakup, I deleted instagram as I had no more use for it - no more couple photos or stories.
Also this would time would better blur those past four years from my mind.</p>
<p>These deletion came as the last piece in a “abandoning social media” saga, as I had previously stopped using WhatsApp and other common methods of interaction.</p>
<p>I continued using Discord for my “socialization” - In a move I can only describe as “nerd arrogance”, since Discord offers no significant advantage to other communication methods: Its not private, its freemium, and its not open software.</p>
<p>##Back into the modern world of digital bubble gum interactions</p>
<p>As my real-life interactions got progressivly better, my “nerd rage against the modern world” diminished.</p>
<p>I installed WhatsApp again to the delight of friends and family, as it is a very convenient method of communication (since everyone uses it, although I still have no fond feeling for it)</p>
<p>….And I went back to the instagram trap.</p>
<p>But it was different this time</p>
<p>Honestly, I installed instagram as a soft dating app (note: Went on a total of 0 dates thanks to instagram).</p>
<p>This is of course very sad, and only a symptom of a deeper issue.</p>
