# Coming Soon!

# Introduction

Most FPGA development boards are expensive. Either from Digilent (AMD Xilinx), Altera or Lattice entry-point, ready-to-use FPGA boards usually start at 150$. I wouldn't say that this price is outrageous, especially from the eyes of an enthusiast of Reconfigurable Computing, but from a generic hobbyist point of view expending 150$ for something that you **just want to try**, no future guarantees attached it may be a bit dismaying.

# The EBAZ4205

Enter the EBAZ4205, a development board based on the Zynq7010 SoC-FPGA from AMD Xilinx.
