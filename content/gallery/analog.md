Welcome to my analog photography gallery, the only page in my website that uses JavaScript!

Most of the photos here are taken with a Ricoh KR-5 and are normally developed and scanned at the awesome [Carmencita Lisboa](https://carmencitafilmlab.com/lisboa/) film lab and scanned in the [NAF](https://nucleodeartefotografica.pt/sobre) lab.

Sometimes I also develop and scan on my own, with various results (And so, if some photography looks odd, it was probably my fault). 

All these technical details are available in each photography description, along with a tiny tiny text about it.

As of now my favorite stocks to shoot are **Kodak ColorPlus 200** and **Kentmere Pan 400**.
