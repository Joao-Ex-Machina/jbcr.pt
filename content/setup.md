# My Everyday Carry (EDC)

Normally I carry my EDC in a light brown leather satchel given to me by my parents and in my many pockets.

### Modded Thinkpad T430 aka Khazad-Dûm I (RIP)

My (old, see update) daily-driver portable computer since December 2021, when I bought it from a portuguese government official for the modest price of 180€.

Since it was a government machine it came with many priviliges, such as an **embedded card reader** and a **fingerprint sensor**.

Since then, I have also changed many components of it such as: the keyboard, screen, processor, ultrabay and even switched the motherboard for a **Corebooted-one**.

Below you can see my neofetch output:

It simply suits my needs. It drives Arch GNU/Linux perfectly, runs the Vivado suite smoothly (although a bit slowly), surfs the web and allows me to SSH and RDP into more powerful computers at INESC-ID.

**Update**: As of January 2026 the original Khazad-Dûm seems to have died. After months of inactivity, it failed to boot from the disk, displaying corrupted colourful blocks. After that it stopped achieving POST. I will try to find a way to fix it, but for now it is a RIP to this old, old friend.

### Modded Thinkpad X200 aka Khazad-Dûm II

My second daily-driver computer, which has recently become my go to.

The x200 normally drives the **Khazad-Dûm SSD**, as I rarely need both computers at the same time.
This 12-inch machine is incredibly lightweight and portable, sturdy, lets me surf the web, work on my terminal and SSH into powerful machines if needed be.

It just **Just Works**™!


I've bought a X201 MoBo to upgrade it, and soon the wifi and BIOS will be upgraded too, to increase this delightful machine's lifespan.

**Update:** As of January 2026 the X200 (fka Aglarond) as been re-baptized as Khazad-Dûm, after the apparent death of its predecessor. It is now my daily driver.

### The Rest

Normally, in my day to day I also carry:

- My black leather wallet
    - My ID cards, debit card and some money
- A HONOR 90 Lite cellphone
- My **Hunter Lockblade Swiss Army knife** from the '90s
- My **smoking pipe** and a tin of tobacco or a cigarrete pack
- My House and HackerSchool keys, in a Ubuntu keychain
- A **book** for reading during breaks
    - As of now: _A hora de Sertório_ by João Aguiar

This website (and soon other self-hosted services) are running from a T410 found in a garden bench as its mentioned in [this post](/blog/selfhost-parti). I have fixed it, clean it and it now drives Ubuntu.
