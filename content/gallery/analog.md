Welcome to my analog photography gallery!

Most of the photos here are taken with a Ricoh KR-5 and are normally developed at the awesome [Carmencita Lisboa](https://carmencitafilmlab.com/lisboa/) film lab and scanned in the [NAF](https://nucleodeartefotografica.pt/sobre) lab. Sometimes I also develop on my own, with various results.

As of now my favorite stocks to shoot are SantaColor 100, Kodak ColorPlus 200 and Kentmere Pan 400. I really liked shooting Portra too.
