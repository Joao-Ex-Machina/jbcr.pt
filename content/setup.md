# My Everyday Carry (EDC)

Normally I carry my EDC in a light brown leather satchel given to me by my parents, or in my pockets.

### Modded Thinkpad T430 aka Khazad-Dûm

My daily-driver portable computer since December 2022, when I bought it from a portuguese government official for the modest price of 180€.

Since it was a government machine it came with many priviliges, such as a **embedded card reader** and a **fingerprint sensor**.

Since then, I have also changed many components of it such as: the keyboard, screen, processor, ultrabay and even switched the motherboard for a **Corebooted-one**.

Below you can see my neofetch output:

It simply suits my needs. It drives Arch GNU/Linux perfectly, runs the Vivado suite smoothly (although a bit slowly), surfs the web and allows me to SSH and RDP into more powerfull computers at INESC-ID.

### The Rest

Normally, in my day to day I also carry:

- My black leather wallet
    - My ID cards, debit card and some money
- A HONOR 90 Lite cellphone
- My **Hunter Lockblade Swiss Army knife** from the '90s
- My **smoking pipe** and a tin of tobacco
- My House and HackerSchool keys, in a Ubuntu keychain

### Battlestation

### Server

This website (and soon other self-hosted services) are running from a T410 found in a garden bench as its mentioned in [this post](/blog/selfhost-parti). I have fixed it, clean it and it now drives Ubuntu.
