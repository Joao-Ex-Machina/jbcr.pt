V.I.S.O.R. is an AI-powered voiced assistant which has been in development since 2017. My dear friend [Eduardo "Eddichka" aka Edw590](https://github.com/Edw590) is the original and main developer, working mostly on the Voice Assistant, App interface(s) and AI integration. 

For V.I.S.O.R. I mostly contribute for the hardware/mechatronic interfaces, with ideas for the software parts or as a heinous tester!
