[jbcr.pt](https://jbcr.pt) is officially live!
You can expect a big blog post detailing my unexpected journey on making this website work soon!

I would like to thank those that helped me reach this goal:

[José Duarte Lopes](https://joselopes.dev) for motivating and guiding me through this world filled with crazy magic words such has: nginx, html and toml

[Filipe Piçarra](https://fpicarra.dev) for providing the domain when I did not have a way to generate burner-debit cards

My friends at Canto do SCDEEC, namely Duarte, Catarina, Isabella, [Eduardo](https://github.com/Edw590) and Tiago for their insightful comments on structure, design and typos

Pai e Mãe for their advices, support and beta-testing
