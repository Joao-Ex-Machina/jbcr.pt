<p>On the last weekend I was at my (dead) great-uncle&rsquo;s and (dead) great-aunt&rsquo;s house in Arraiolos. On the hallway, placed atop of the chest, there it was - an <strong>Agfamatic 108 Sensor camera</strong>, waiting for an hacker to save it from certain disposal:</p>
<p><img src="/agfamatic.jpeg" alt="Agfamatic 108 Sensor"></p>
<p>The wise man and wise woman that generated me, warned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That camera is sh***, its trash, don&rsquo;t bother with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I empathized with the otherwordly object.</p>
<p>I reached to it, inspected it and opened it&hellip;..<em>gasp</em>&hellip;&hellip;WHAT THE HELL IS THIS:</p>
<p><img src="/cassete_agfa.jpeg" alt="WTF!!"></p>
<p><strong>A DAMNED CASSETTE-LIKE CARTRIDGE??</strong> WHAT UNHOLY FORMAT IS THIS?</p>
<p>A quick <a href="https://camera-wiki.org/">camera wiki</a> search provided the magical answer - 126mm format - a dead, buried and mostly forgotten format, discontinued in late 2007.</p>
<p>This camera had peaked my interest, but now&hellip;.now it had my attention :)</p>
<h1 id="does-it-work">Does it work?</h1>
<p>The cartridge had 13 photograms taken. I pulled the lever, pressed the trigger and a satisfying <em>click</em> emerged&hellip;It seemed to work!</p>
<p>I repeated this process&hellip;.<em>click click click</em>&hellip;.and I exhausted the cartridge - time to examine it:</p>
<p>Two pieces of platic make up the shell, with a window for the film to be exposed and a little window at the back to count the pictures taken.</p>
<p><a href="">Opened Cartridge</a></p>
<p>I manually pulled the film backward, through the little window (honestly the film that was there was probably expired <strong>plus</strong>).</p>
<h1 id="is-there-a-solution">Is there a solution?</h1>
<p>Great question attentive reader!</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>yes</strong> - If you have a darkroom/darkbag available, some 35mm film, tape, finesse and some patience.</p>
<p>My good friends at <a href="">NAF</a> have a darkroom available. They have nice workshops and open-days, go show them some love - they deserve it.</p>
<p>As you may already know I lack on the last two requirements, therefore the colleagues at the room next door had to hear some pretty loud &ldquo;FODA-SE ESTA MERDA, CARALHO&rdquo; curses during the handspooling process.</p>
<h1 id="methodology-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-lomography">Methodology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Lomography</h1>
<p>Basically what you are going to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully open the cartridge
<ol>
<li>You may optionally do this in a dark room to save the original film, if it was photographed</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Gut out the film from the backing paper, being careful not to rip it</li>
<li>Analyze the cartridge and familiarize yourself with its anatomy, take notice of cracks or possible light leaks</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/open_cart.jpeg" alt="Open cartridge"></p>
<p><strong>Now for the spooling process, João Rodrigues style:</strong></p>
<p><img src="/agfa_setup.jpeg" alt="The setup"></p>
<ol>
<li>Tape your film leader to the desired end of the backing paper (I did the first batch with ~12 photograms). remeber that the emulsion side should face you
<ol>
<li>Here you can cut the leader, give some give, <em>sui generis</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/agfa_schematic.jpg" alt="The schematic"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Now turn off the lights in the darkroom! You will now unspool and tape the 35mm film to the &ldquo;begining&rdquo; of the backing paper, where the old 126 film was glued</p>
<ol>
<li>Once again <em>sui generis</em></li>
<li>Also you can optionally f*** up this process several times:
<ol>
<li>Untapping the end and having to respool the 35mm back into the canister, turning on the lights and redo the whole process</li>
<li>Putting too much tape</li>
<li>Putting your dirty paws on the emulsion&hellip;leaving fingerprints for some extra <em><em>chef kiss</em></em> lomography</li>
<li>Etc. Bonus points for finding your own way to completly botch your job</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, carefully roll the backing paper and film item in a tight, neat cilinde</p>
<ol>
<li>Be sure it is nice and tight, if you cannot fit it in the compartment, you&rsquo;ll have to redo it</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fit the backing paper and film item in its compartment and the spooling cilinder in the other compartment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close the cartridge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn on the lights and give your camera some cranks until it <em>clicks</em> in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe shoot once and crank to see the feel of it :)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And you just hacked your first 126 cartridge!</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>I made the first test with a little less than 12 frames, 200 ISO indoors:</p>
<p><img src="/agfa_results.jpeg" alt="some result"></p>
<p>As expected the film as little information - but that is a good thing! No burned film, no major light leaks, no overlapping frames, and the <strong>image extends to the sprocket holes</strong>, which looks pretty cool!</p>
<p>I also tried to load a full cartridge with 24 frames, but I struggle to fit the film roll, the camera struggled to crank it, and the cartridge kept on popping open - It was a botched job which ended with me chucking the film in the trash. <strong>I would keep it to 12-15 frames</strong>, but I will try again in the future.</p>
<p>I might update this section with some more results in the future&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?</h1>
<p>It does depend on various factors and how you rank them in order of enjoyment, so I made this helpful table to agilize your decision process:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th style="text-align: center"><strong>Feature</strong></th>
          <th style="text-align: center"><strong>Qualitative Grade</strong></th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center">Hassle-free?</td>
          <td style="text-align: center">❌❌</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center">Quality</td>
          <td style="text-align: center">❌</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center">Novelty</td>
          <td style="text-align: center">✓✓</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center">Bragging rights</td>
          <td style="text-align: center">✓✓</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center">Fun?</td>
          <td style="text-align: center">¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Additionally this is a <strong>destructive</strong> process, as the tape will start to wear off on the backing paper, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future work</h1>
<p>As I was finishing this post for deployment I verified that I might have <strong>broken</strong> the camera - It seems like the lever isn&rsquo;t pulling properly no more. Years of no-use with the additional experimental method can do this to a banged up, fixed lens, plastic camera&hellip;.</p>
<p>I will try to fix it, but this model is also <strong>quite cheap on the second-hand market</strong>, normally below 15€ - and so, if that time comes, I will just buy a new one, as I&rsquo;ve become addicted to this film format, the method, and the &lsquo;LOmOGRaphY&rsquo;</p>
<p><img src="/lomo_cope.jpg" alt="Lomo Copium"></p>
<p>Using orthographic film is also on the to-do list, as it would simplify a lot the hand spooling process (and I also think it looks good)!</p>
<p>I will now stop here, as the source-code for this post has 126 lines, which seemed fitting :)</p>
<p>Signing off!</p>
