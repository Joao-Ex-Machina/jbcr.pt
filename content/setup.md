# My Everyday Carry (EDC)

Normally I carry my EDC in a light brown leather satchel, given to me by my parents or in my pockets.

### Modded Thinkpad T430

My daily-driver portable computer since December 2022, when I bought it from a portuguese government official for the modest price of 180â‚¬.

Since it was a government machine it came with many priviliges, such as a **embedded card reader** and a **fingerprint sensor**.

Since then, I have changed many components of it such as the keyboard, screen, processor, ultrabay and even switched the motherboard for a **Corebooted-one**.

Below you can see my neofetch output:

It simply suits my needs driving Arch GNU/Linux, running the Vivado suite smoothly (although a bit slowly), surfing the web and allowing me to SSH and RDP into more powerfull computer at INESC-ID.

### The Rest

Normally in my day to day I carry:

- My black leather wallet
    - My ID cards, debit card and some money
- A HONOR 90 Lite cellphone
- My **Hunter Lockblade Swiss Army knife** from the '90s
- My **smoking pipe** and a tin of tobacco
- My House and HackerSchool keys, in a Ubuntu keychain
