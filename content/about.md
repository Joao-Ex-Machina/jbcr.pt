I am a 23 year old **Electrical and Computer Eng. Master's student** at [Instituto Superior Técnico - ULisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt), majoring in **Computer Systems** and minoring in **Electronic Circuits and Systems**, with a knack for all things FPGA and Reconfigurable Computing

As of now I am finishing my MSc Thesis on a Hardware/Software Co-Designed Embedded System for Aerial Image Segmentation based on Transformers at INESC-ID/INESC-INOV under Prof. Horácio Neto and Prof. Mário Véstias. I will continue my work on hardware design for Artificial Intelligence as a PhD student, with the same supervisors. 
From 2023 to July 2025 I was a **Teaching Assistant** at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://deec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) teaching on the following courses:

- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Digital Systems
- Programming
- Computer Architectures

I enjoyed this experience throughly, winning the **Excelence in Teaching** award for the school year of 23/24.

I have also been **hackin' and tinkerin'** while involved with the [HackerSchool](https://hackerschool.dev) hackerspace, which I belong to since 2021. At HackerSchool I have assumed the following functions:

- **Board Member (Marketing)** in 2022
- **President** from 2022 to 2024
- **Board Member (Chief Hacker Officer)** from 2024 until now
